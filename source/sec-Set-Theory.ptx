    <p>
      When we perform an experiment, there are many results that we might see.
      We want to be able to quantify the likelihood of seeing certain results.
      For this, we need to develop some mathematical terminology.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-sample-space">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>sample space</term>, often denoted <m>\Omega</m>, is the set of all possible results of an experiment.
          A single result is called an <term>outcome</term>, while a collection of results is called an <term>event</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <example xml:id="example-sample-space">
      <statement>
        <p>
          An experiment consists of rolling a standard 6-sided die.
          The sample space is <m>\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}</m>.
          One possible event is <m>A = \{2, 4, 6\}</m>, i.e., the event that the result of the roll is even.
        </p>

        <p>
          What would the sample space look like if we roll the die two times and recorded the results?

          Let <m>A</m> be a set.
          The symbol <m>\in</m> means "is an element of", as in <m>a \in A</m>.
          Given another set <m>B</m>, we say <m>A</m> is a <term>subset</term> of <m>B</m>, written <m>A\subset B</m>, to mean that every element of the set <m>A</m> is also an element of the set <m>B</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      The subset symbol includes the possibility that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are equal sets, i.e., that they contain precisely the same elements.

          Suppose we flip a coin two times.
          List the set of all possible results.
          What about flipping three times? Four times? If we flip the coin 10 times, how many possible results will there be?

      <answer>
        <p>
          For two flips: <m>\Omega = \{ HH, HT, TH, TT \}</m>.

          For three flips: <m>\Omega = \{ HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT \}</m>.

            <mrow> \Omega = \{ \amp HHHH, HHHT, HHTH, HTHH, </mrow>

          Each additional flip doubles the number of outcomes.
