            Let <m>\Omega</m> be a sample space.
            A <term>random variable</term> is a function <m>X \colon \Omega \to \R</m> which assigns a number to each outcome.

      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Suppose an experiment consists of flipping a fair coin 4 times.
            Let <m>X</m> be the number of heads.
            The actual outcomes in the experiment are heads/tails sequences of length 4, such as <m>HTHT</m> and <m>HHHT</m>.
            The random variable <m>X</m> assigns a numerical measurement to the outcomes, such as <m>X(HTHT) = 2</m> and <m>X(HHHT) = 3</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            For any real number value <m>a</m>, we can consider the event consisting of outcomes such that <m>X = a</m>.
            For example, the flip sequences <m>HHHT, HHTH, HTHH</m>, and <m>THHH</m> all have 3 heads, so <m>\Pr(X = 3) = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4}</m>.

        <title>Indicator Random Variable</title>

        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>A</m> be an event in the sample space <m>\Omega</m>.
            An <term>indicator random variable</term> for <m>A</m> is the random variable <m>X</m> such that

      </example>

      <p>
        Indicator random variables are also called <term>Bernoulli random variables</term>, although we'll prefer the former term since it more clearly states the purpose of these random variables: to indicate whether or not a particular event has occurred.
        We'll use the language "<m>X</m> indicates <m>A</m>" to mean that <m>X</m> is an indicator random variable for the event <m>A</m>.
        In this case, <m>\Pr(X = 1) = \Pr(A)</m>, and <m>\Pr(X = 0) = 1 - \Pr(A)</m>.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Consider the set <m>S</m> of all real numbers which are actually output by a random variable <m>X</m>.
            If <m>S</m> does not contain any interval of values, then the random variable <m>X</m> is called <term>discrete</term>.
            Otherwise, it's called <term>continuous</term>.

      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Any random variable <m>X</m> defined on a finite sample space <m>\Omega</m> is discrete<mdash/>the set of outputs of <m>X</m> cannot contain an interval if it only has finitely many values.
          </p>

          <p>
            Suppose an experiment consists of growing a plant in a new fertilizer, and a random variable <m>Y</m> measures the height of the plant after a set growing period.
            Now <m>Y</m> could conceivably take on an interval's worth of values (such as, e.g., any real number between 10 inches and 20 inches), so this random variable would be continuous.
          </p>

          <p>
            The distinction between discrete and continuous random variables is not simply the distinction of whether the sample space is finite or infinite.
            Consider the experiment in which we flip a coin repeatedly until we first see a coin come up heads.
            Let <m>Z</m> be the number of times the coin is flipped.
            Then there are infinitely many possible values of <m>Z</m> (1, 2, 3, and so on), but there's no interval of real numbers which are all possible outputs of <m>Z</m>.
            The possible outputs of <m>Z</m> are discrete (in the non-technical, English sense of the word: separated).

      <p>
        There are several particular types of distributions that appear repeatedly, since they model common behaviors.
        Indicator random variables, for example, will appear any time a random process generates a yes/no or success/failure type of answer to a question.
        Below are some other common distributions.

      <p>
        To understand how these probabilities are calculated, consider a particular heads/tails sequence, such as <m>HHHT</m>.
        If the probability of heads is 0.4, then the probability of tails is 0.6.
        Since the results of different coin flips are independent from each other, the probability of seeing precisely the sequence <m>HHT</m> would be the product <m>(0.4)(0.4)(0.6) = 0.096</m>.
        The probability of seeing precisely <m>HTH</m> would be <m>(0.4)(0.6)(0.4) = 0.096</m>, the same product of terms in a different order.
        So, if we knew exactly the number of flip sequences of length 3 with exactly 2 heads, we could calculate the probability of seeing 2 heads as:
        <md>
          <mrow> \Pr(S = 2) = (\text{number of sequences})(\text{probability of each sequence}) </mrow>
        </md>
        The probability for each sequence is straightforward to generalize: if there are <m>n</m> flips and <m>k</m> of them are heads, then <m>n - k</m> of them are tails.
        So the product we should calculate will have <m>k</m> copies of the parameter <m>p</m> and <m>n - k</m> copies of the complementary probability <m>1 - p</m>:
        <md>
          <mrow>\text{probability of each sequence } = p^k(1-p)^k</mrow>

            We'll write the symbol <m>{n \choose k}</m> to mean the number of ways to choose <m>k</m> things out of <m>n</m> things.
            The number <m>{n \choose k}</m> is read "<m>n</m> choose <m>k</m>" and called a <term>binomial coefficient</term>.

      <p>
        The term "binomial coefficient" is used here because these numbers form coefficients of a polynomial in an important theorem about binomials called the <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_theorem">Binomial Theorem</url>.
        The binomial coefficients will precisely tell us the number of flip sequences of length <m>n</m> with precisely <m>k</m> heads (to build such a sequence, we must choose <m>k</m> out of <m>n</m> flips in the sequence to be heads; the rest must be tails).
        So, now we need a way to find the numbers <m>{n \choose k}</m>.

            Let <m>n</m> be a positive integer.
            Then the <term>factorial</term> of <m>n</m>, written <m>n!</m>, is the product of the positive integers up to <m>n</m>, i.e.:

      <p>
        We won't provide a justification of this formula here, but we'll put it to use to calculate probabilities in the binomial distribution.
        For example, the number of flip sequences of length 3 with exactly 2 heads is:

          <mrow> {3 \choose 2} = \frac{3!}{2!1!} = \frac{6}{2} = 3. </mrow>
        </md>
        Since we previously said the probability of such a sequence is 0.096, we can now find the probability of seeing exactly 2 heads in 3 flips of the coin:
        <md>
          <mrow> \Pr(S = 2) \amp = (\text{number of sequences})(\text{probability of each sequence}) </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp = (3)(0.096) </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp = 0.288, </mrow>

      <p>
        The term <m>\lambda t</m> is potentially misleading here depending on the units given for each value.
        The idea is that the rate information might be given for a different period of time than the observation period, so the rate should be scaled before calculating a probability.
        But the rate and observation time must be using the same time unit before multiplying.
        See the following example.

      <example xml:id="example-poisson-rate">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Suppose we observe traffic along a particular stretch of highway which typically has 200 cars pass per hour.
            Let <m>N</m> be the number of cars seen in a 2-hour observation period.
            Since the parameter <m>\lambda = 200</m> cars per hour is given for a 1-hour period, we should scale it to find the rate for a 2-hour period: <m>\lambda t = (200)(2) = 400</m> cars per 2-hours.
            Then, for example:
            <md>
              <mrow> \Pr(N = 375) = p(375; 200, 2) = \frac{400^{375}}{375!} e^{-400} \approx 0.01. </mrow>
            </md>
          </p>

          <p>
            Now consider the random variable <m>M</m> counting the number of cars seen in a 30-minute observation period.
            We should not calculate <m>\lambda t = (200)(30) = 6000</m>, since <m>\lambda</m> measures time in hours and <m>t</m> measures time in minutes.
            We should first convert <m>t = 0.5</m> hours, then we can find our appropriately scaled rate information: <m>(200)(0.5) = 100</m> cars per half-hour.
            Then, for example:
            <md>
              <mrow> \Pr(M = 110) = p(110; 200, 0.5) = \frac{100^{110}}{110!}e^{-100} \approx 0.02. </mrow>

            Note that when we write the notation <m>p(k; \lambda, t)</m>, we assume that <m>\lambda</m> and <m>t</m> are expressed with the same time units already.

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-pdfs">
      <title>Probability Density Functions</title>

      <p>
        We have to think about probability differently for continuous random variables.
        If <m>X</m> is a continuous random variable taking values in an interval <m>[a, b]</m>, it doesn't quite make sense to ask, as we have for discrete random variables, to find the probabilities of each individual outcome.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we roll a fair 6-sided die, there are 6 equally likely outcomes, so they each get assigned the probability <m>1/6</m>.
        If we try to select a random number in the interval <m>[0, 1]</m> in a similarly "fair" way (i.e., with each outcome equally likely), then what probability <m>\alpha</m> should we assign to each outcome? If <m>\alpha > 0</m>, then we have a problem: if you add up the probabilities of all the (infinitely many) outcomes, you get an infinite total, whereas the total probability in any sample space should be 1.
        If <m>\alpha = 0</m>, then we also have a problem: if you add up the probabilities of all the outcomes, you get total of 0, whereas the total probability in any sample space should be 1.
      </p>

      <p>
        We need a new way to model and calculate probabilities for continuous random variables.

      <p>
        It's important to keep in mind that the output values of a pdf <m>f(x)</m> are <em>probability densities</em>, not probabilities.
        You can (somewhat casually) think of the units of <m>f(x)</m> values as "probability per &lt;units of the sample space&gt;".
        You may not have discussed the units of the differential <m>dx</m> very much in your Calculus 1 course, but <m>dx</m> has the same units as <m>x</m> and is being multiplied by the integrand when you take an integral.
        So, although <m>f(x)</m> is not a probability, the result of computing <m>\int_c^d f(x)\ dx</m> <em>is</em> a probability.
      </p>

      <p>
        A pdf's purpose in life is to be integrated, which tells us probabilities for a continuous random variable:
        <md>
          <mrow> \Pr(c \leq X \leq d) = \int_c^d f(x)\ dx. </mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <definition xml:id="def-continuous-uniform-distribution">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>X</m> take values in the interval <m>[a, b]</m>.
            We say that <m>X</m> has the <term>uniform distribution</term> if, for any subinterval <m>[c, d] \subset [a, b]</m>, the probability that <m>X</m> lies within <m>[c, d]</m> is equal to the proportion of the total sample space taken by <m>[c, d]</m>.
            That is:
            <md>
              <mrow> \Pr(c \leq X \leq d) = \frac{d - c}{b - a}. </mrow>
            </md>
            In this case, <m>X</m> has the pdf <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{b - a}</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>

      <p>
        We'll ignore for the moment how to find this pdf and instead we'll quickly check that it behaves the way we want it to:
        <md>
          <mrow> \Pr(c \leq X \leq d) \amp = \int_c^d \frac{1}{b-a}\ dx </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp = \frac{x}{b - a}\bigg|_c^d </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp = \frac{d - c}{b - a}, </mrow>
        </md>
        as we wanted.
      </p>

      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>X</m> be a continuous random variable taking values in the interval <m>[0, 4]</m> with pdf <m>f(x) = k \sqrt{x}</m> for some constant <m>k</m>.
            Because of the restriction that the total probability must be 1, we can determine the value of <m>k</m>:
            <md>
              <mrow> 1 = \Pr(0\leq X \leq 4) \amp = \int_0^4 k\sqrt{x}\ dx </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \frac{kx^{3/2}}{3/2}\bigg|_0^4 </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \frac{2kx^{3/2}}{3}\bigg|_0^4 </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \left(\frac{2k(4^{3/2})}{3}\right) - 0 </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \frac{16k}{3} </mrow>
            </md>
            Therefore <m> k = \frac{3}{16}</m>.
            Now we can calculate probabilities, e.g.:
            <md>
              <mrow> \Pr(1 \leq X \leq 2) \amp = \int_1^2 \frac{3\sqrt{x}}{16}\ dx </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \frac{3}{16}\left(\frac{2x^{3/2}}{3}\right)\bigg|_1^2 </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \frac{1}{8}\left(x^{3/2}\right)\bigg|_1^2 </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \frac{1}{8}\left( 2^{3/2} - 1 \right) </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp \approx 0.23. </mrow>
            </md>
          </p>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-cdf">
      <title>Cumulative Distribution Functions</title>

      <p>
        When a random variable takes values in an interval <m>[a, b]</m>, it's often useful to consider how much probability has been accumulated up to some specified value <m>x \in [a, b]</m>.
        For each value of <m>x</m>, we can calculate this accumulated probability.
        Since there's an association between inputs (the <m>x</m> values) and output (the accumulated probability), we can naturally build a function.
      </p>

      <definition xml:id="def-cdf">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>X</m> be a continuous random variable taking values in an interval <m>[a, b]</m>.
            The <term>cumulative distribution function</term> (or <term>cdf</term>) is the function <m>F(x)</m> defined on <m>[a, b]</m> such that
            <md>
              <mrow> F(x) = \Pr(a \leq X \leq x). </mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>

      <p>
        How do we actually calculate these cumulative probabilities? Luckily, these are precisely the sort of probabilities we can use the pdf to find:
        <md>
          <mrow> F(x) = \Pr(a \leq X \leq x) = \int_a^x f(t)\ dt. </mrow>
        </md>
        (Note that on the far left side of the equation, we used the letter <m>x</m> to refer to some point within <m>[a, b]</m> up to which we're trying to accumulate probability.
        So that value <m>x</m> must also appear at the top of the integral sign.
        We can't then use the same letter for the integrand and differential inside the integral; we can't use the same letter to refer to two different variables at the same time.
        So, we have changed the letter inside the integral to <m>t</m>.)
      </p>

      <p>
        This equation may look familiar from Calculus 1.
        If you review <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus#First_part">the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</url>, you'll see precisely the relationship between the cdf <m>F(x)</m> and the pdf <m>f(x)</m>:
        <md>
          <mrow> F'(x) = f(x). </mrow>
        </md>
        Let's see how we can put this relationship to use.
      </p>

      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Suppose <m>X</m> is uniformly distributed in the interval <m>[a, b]</m>.
            We previously said in <xref ref="def-continuous-uniform-distribution"/> that, for any subinterval <m>[c, d] \subset [a, b]</m>, we should have
            <md>
              <mrow> \Pr(c\leq X \leq d) = \frac{d - c}{b - a}. </mrow>
            </md>
            In particular, for any <m>x\in [a, b]</m>, we would have:
            <md>
              <mrow> F(x) = \Pr(a \leq X \leq x) = \frac{x - a}{b - a}. </mrow>
            </md>
            Therefore, taking the derivative:
            <md>
              <mrow> f(x) = F'(x) = \frac{1}{b - a}. </mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
        </statement>
      </example>

      <p>
        So, we can see that the idea we wanted to capture in probability led to a formula that gave accumulated probability, which then led to the pdf.
        Both the cdf and the pdf contain essentially all of the information we need to answer probability questions about <m>X</m>.
        However, keep in mind that these functions output different mathematical objects.
        <m>F(x)</m> outputs probabilities already; <m>f(x)</m> must be integrated over a subinterval to find probabilities.

      <p>
        The binomial, geometric, Poisson, and exponential distributions are conceptually grouped together.
        Consider the following two dichotomies:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Is time being measured discretely or continuously?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Does the random variable count occurrences of an event, or does it measure time until an event?
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        There are four combinations of answers to these two questions.
        <dl>
        <li>
          <title>Binomial</title>

          <p>
            "Time" is discrete; the random variables counts occurrences.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>Geometric</title>

          <p>
            "Time" is discrete; the random variable measures "time" until an event.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>Poisson</title>

          <p>
            Time is continuous; the random variable counts occurrences.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>Exponential</title>

          <p>
            Time is continuous; the random variable measures time until an event.
          </p>
        </li>
        </dl> When we talk about discrete "time", we don't always mean something measured in actual units of time. We might; for example, an experiment may involve a bacterial colony growing in a petri dish over time, but we only check in and measure something about the bacterial colony once each day. In this case, since our measurements of time must occur in whole numbers of days, time is being measured in a discrete way (that is, not involving an interval of real numbers).
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider, instead, an experiment in which we flip a coin repeatedly until we first see heads appear.
        The number of flips doesn't have units of time, but counting flips is analogous to measuring time until an event occurs.
        The flip count is a discrete stand-in for something analogous to time.
        We can consider this experiment to be a discrete analog of a Poisson process.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's also worth including a warning here about the Poisson distribution, specifically.
        The dichotomy mentioned above about whether time is being measured discretely or continuously is <em>not</em> the same as the consideration of whether the random variable itself is discrete or continuous.
        In a Poisson process, time is being measured continuously.
        But the Poisson random variable counts the number of occurrences of the event, and this number must be a whole number.
        So a Poisson random variable is a discrete random variable.

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-normal-distribution">
      <title>Normal Distribution</title>

      <definition xml:id="def-normal-distribution">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Consider the parametrized family of functions:
            <md>
              <mrow> f(x; \mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} e^{\frac{-(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}. </mrow>
            </md>
            The function <m>f(x; \mu, \sigma^2)</m> is called a <term>normal density function</term> with parameters <m>\mu</m> and <m>\sigma^2</m>.
            A continuous random variable <m>X</m> with pdf <m>f(x; \mu, \sigma^2)</m> is said to have a <term>normal distribution</term>.
            In the specific case that <m>\mu = 0</m> and <m>\sigma^2 = 1</m>, we call the resulting distribution the <term>standard normal distribution</term>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>

      <p>
        It's an unfortunate reality that the normal density functions can't easily be integrated.
        (In fact, it is provably impossible to write nice formulas for their antiderivatives).
        So we won't worry much about probability computations like <m>\Pr(c \leq X \leq d)</m> for normal distributions.
        The normal distributions will play a <em>central</em> role in later chapters (after which you can return here and appreciate this pun).
