    <title>Discrete Random Variables</title>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\Omega</m> be a sample space.
          A <term>random variable</term> is a function <m>X \colon \Omega \to \mathbb{R}</m> which assigns a number to each outcome.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose an experiment consists of flipping a fair coin 4 times.
          Let <m>X</m> be the number of heads.
          The actual outcomes in the experiment are heads/tails sequences of length 4, such as <m>HTHT</m> and <m>HHHT</m>.
          The random variable <m>X</m> assigns a numerical measurement to the outcomes, such as <m>X(HTHT) = 2</m> and <m>X(HHHT) = 3</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          For any real number value <m>a</m>, we can consider the event consisting of outcomes such that <m>X = a</m>.
          For example, the flip sequences <m>HHHT, HHTH, HTHH</m>, and <m>THHH</m> all have 3 heads, so <m>\Pr(X = 3) = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example>
      <title>Indicator Random Variable</title>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be an event in the sample space <m>\Omega</m>.
          An <term>indicator random variable</term> for <m>A</m> is the random variable <m>X</m> such that
          <md>
            <mrow> X(\omega) = \begin{cases}  1 \amp \omega \in A \\ 0 \amp \omega \notin A \end{cases} </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p>
      Indicator random variables are also called <term>Bernoulli random variables</term>, although we'll prefer the former term since it more clearly states the purpose of these random variables: to indicate whether or not a particular event has occurred.
      We'll use the language "<m>X</m> indicates <m>A</m>" to mean that <m>X</m> is an indicator random variable for the event <m>A</m>.
      In this case, <m>\Pr(X = 1) = \Pr(A)</m>, and <m>\Pr(X = 0) = 1 - \Pr(A)</m>.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-discrete-and-continuous">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the set <m>S</m> of all real numbers which are actually output by a random variable <m>X</m>.
          If <m>S</m> does not contain any interval of values, then the random variable <m>X</m> is called <term>discrete</term>.
          Otherwise, it's called <term>continuous</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Any random variable <m>X</m> defined on a finite sample space <m>\Omega</m> is discrete<mdash/>the set of outputs of <m>X</m> cannot contain an interval if it only has finitely many values.
        </p>

        <p>
          Suppose an experiment consists of growing a plant in a new fertilizer, and a random variable <m>Y</m> measures the height of the plant after a set growing period.
          Now <m>Y</m> could conceivably take on an interval's worth of values (such as, e.g., any real number between 10 inches and 20 inches), so this random variable would be continuous.
        </p>

        <p>
          The distinction between discrete and continuous random variables is not simply the distinction of whether the sample space is finite or infinite.
          Consider the experiment in which we flip a coin repeatedly until we first see a coin come up heads.
          Let <m>Z</m> be the number of times the coin is flipped. Then there are infinitely many possible values of <m>Z</m> (1, 2, 3, and so on), but there's no interval of real numbers which are all possible outputs of <m>Z</m>.
          The possible outputs of <m>Z</m> are discrete (in the non-technical, English sense of the word: separated).
