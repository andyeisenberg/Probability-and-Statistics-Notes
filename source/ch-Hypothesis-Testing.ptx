            We have a coin which we've flipped many times, seeing an above-average number of heads.
            We suspect the coin comes up heads more often than a fair coin would.

            In a medical study, a group of patients are gathered and the proportion experiencing particular symptoms is measured.
            A new drug intended to eliminate these symptoms is administered, after which the proportion experiencing symptoms is measured again.

          As a first test, we decide to flip the coin 200 times and count the number of heads.
          If we see 112 heads, should we accept or reject the null hypothesis of a fair coin at a significance level of 0.05?

          We suspect that growing this plant in a greenhouse will increase its height.
          A sample of 50 plants grown in a greenhouse has an average height of 40 in.

          We have an established factory which produces coins that are close to fair.
          We're opening up a second factory, and we'd like to ensure the machines are calibrated to produce coins which behave similarly to the ones produced in the established factory.
          We pick one sample coin from each factory, and flip each sample coin 100 times.
          The coin from the established factory flips 52 heads in 100 flips.
          The coin from the new factory flips 62 heads in 100 flips.
          Is this strong enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the two factories produce similar coins at a 0.05 significance level?
