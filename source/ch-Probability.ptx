  <title>Probability Theory</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      This chapter establishes the basic terminology of sample spaces, events, probability, conditional probability, and independence.
      This language lets us model and talk about situations that involve randomness (or lack of knowledge which can sometimes be mathematically modeled in the same way).
