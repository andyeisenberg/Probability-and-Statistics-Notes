          The <term>sample space</term>, often denoted <m>\Omega</m>, is the set of all possible results of an experiment.
          A single result is called an <term>outcome</term>, while a collection of results is called an <term>event</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An experiment consists of rolling a standard 6-sided die.
          The sample space is <m>\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}</m>.
          One possible event is <m>A = \{2, 4, 6\}</m>, i.e., the event that the result of the roll is even.
        </p>

        <p>
          What would the sample space look like if we roll the die two times and recorded the results?

          Let <m>A</m> be a set.
          The symbol <m>\in</m> means "is an element of", as in <m>a \in A</m>.
          Given another set <m>B</m>, we say <m>A</m> is a <term>subset</term> of <m>B</m>, written <m>A\subset B</m>, to mean that every element of the set <m>A</m> is also an element of the set <m>B</m>.

          Consider sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, each contained inside <m>\Omega</m>.

In particular, note that <m>|A\cup B| = 13 \neq 10 + 7 = |A| + |B|</m>, so it is not true in general that the size of the union of sets is the sum of the sizes of the individual sets.
