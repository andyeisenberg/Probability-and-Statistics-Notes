                    Consider the sets <m>A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}</m>, <m>B = \{2, 4, 9, 10, 12, 14, 19\}</m>, and <m>C = \{9, 10, 11, 14, 16, 17, 20\}</m>, which are all subsets of <m>\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, \dotsc, 20\}</m>.

                        <m>|A| = 10</m>, <m>|B| = 7</m>, <m>|C| = 7</m>, <m>|A \cup B| = 13</m>, <m>|A \cap B| = 4</m>, <m>|B\cap C| = 3</m>, <m>|A\cap C| = 2</m>, <m>|A\cup B\cup C| = 17</m>. In particular, note that <m>|A\cup B| = 13 \neq 10 + 7 = |A| + |B|</m>, so it is not true in general that the size of the union of sets is the sum of the sizes of the individual sets.
