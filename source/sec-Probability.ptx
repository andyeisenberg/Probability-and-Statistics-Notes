    <title>Definition of Probability</title>

    <p>
      Now that we have the language to refer to outcomes and events of an experiment, we want to start quantifying how likely those outcomes/events are to occur.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-probability-distribution">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>probability distribution</term> on a sample space <m>\Omega</m> assigns probabilities to every event, satisfying the following conditions:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\Pr(\Omega) = 1</m>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                <m>0 \leq \Pr(A) \leq 1</m> for any event <m>A</m>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>A \cap B = \emptyset</m>, then <m>\Pr(A\cup B) = \Pr(A) + \Pr(B)</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      For small probability spaces (i.e., with finitely many outcomes in the sample space), we'll usually assign probabilities to each individual outcome, and perhaps list them in a table.
      Then, to find the probability of any event, simply add together the probabilities of each outcome in that event.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An experiment consists of rolling a standard 6-sided die.
          The sample space is <m>\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}</m>.
          The probability distribution (assuming a fair die) is shown below.

          One possible event is <m>A = \{2, 4, 6\}</m>, i.e., the event that the result of the roll is even.
          The probability of <m>A</m> is:
          <md>
            <mrow> \Pr(A) = \Pr(2) + \Pr(4) + \Pr(6) = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} </mrow>

    <definition xml:id="def-discrete-uniform-distribution">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\Omega = \{x_1, x_2, \dotsc, x_n\}</m> be a sample space and <m>A\subset \Omega</m> an event.
          We refer to the distribution in which <m>\Pr(x_i) = \frac{1}{n}</m> for all <m>i</m> as the <term>uniform distribution</term>.
          In this case, it follows that <m>\Pr(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}</m>.

      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      When we talk about a fair coin flip or a fair die roll, the word "fair" is indicating a uniform distribution.
      However, don't make the mistake of assuming that all distributions are uniform by default.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A person picks a random number from 1 to 10.
          What is the probability that they picked 3?
        </p>
      </statement>

      <answer>
        <p>
          Without assuming the distribution is fair (i.e., that each value <m>1, 2, \dotsc, 10</m>) has probability <m>1/10</m> of occurring), we don't have enough information to answer this question.
        </p>

        <p>
          In fact, the situation is even more vague than that: the sample space itself is unclear.
          Are we only allowed to pick integer values? What about fractions like <m>7/2</m>? What about irrational numbers like <m>\pi</m>?

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A toxin molecule inside a cell has a 0.3 probability of leaving the cell during a 1-minute period.
          For each value of <m>n = 1, 2, 3, \dotsc</m>, find the probability of the toxin molecule leaving the cell during the <m>n</m>th minute.
          What is the probability of the molecule leaving the cell during the first 3 minutes?
        </p>
      </statement>

      <answer>
        <p>
          For short, write <m>\Pr(n)</m> to mean the probability of the toxin molecule leaving during the <m>n</m>th minute.
          Then <m>\Pr(n) = (0.7)^{n - 1} (0.3).</m>
        </p>

        <p>
          The probability of leaving during the first 3 minutes is <m>\Pr(1) + \Pr(2) + \Pr(3) = 0.657.</m>
